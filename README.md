TOWARDS UPCOMING DATA LOVERS.

A GREAT THANK YOU TO EVERYONE IN LINE WITH MY DATA JOURNEY.

*LESSON LEARNT; 'YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE ALL THE CODES OFF HEAD, JUST KNOW WHEN DO YOU NEED TO USE A CODE,HOW CAN I APPLY THE CODE AND WHERE CAN I GET IT WHEN I WANT TO USE IT.'
*LASTLY, DATA ANALYTICS IS ABOUT PROBLEM SOLVING AND CRITICAL THINKING. TECHNICAL SKILLS JUST HELP US TO USE TOOLS TO GET INSIGHTS AND ANALYSIS THE DATA.
